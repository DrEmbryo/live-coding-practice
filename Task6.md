# Caesar cipher encryption

## Problem statement

You are tasked to create application that displays a Caesar cipher encryption algorithm, which is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in a text by a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

### Data sample for a task

    H becomes K (shift 3 from H)

    E becomes H (shift 3 from E)

    L becomes O (shift 3 from L)

    L becomes O (shift 3 from L)

## Requirements

- Ui should have input fields for encrypting/decrypting messages, and a representation field for an encrypted/decrypted message.
- The UI should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Notes

- You are free to use any frontend technologies or libraries you are comfortable with.
- Focus on writing clean, well-structured, and maintainable code. Consider the performance and efficiency of your solution, especially for large folder structures.
- Make sure to handle edge cases, such as empty folders or invalid data, gracefully.
