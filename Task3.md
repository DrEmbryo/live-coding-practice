# City Road Connectivity

## Problem statement

You are presented with a collection of graph edges that represent roads connecting cities. Your task is to create a UI that allows users to select two cities and determine if there is a path between them.

## Requirements

- Display the list of cities and their connections based on the provided graph edges.
- Provide a way for users to select two cities from the list.
- Implement a function that determines if there is a path between the two selected cities.
- Display the result to the user, indicating whether a path exists or not.
- Handle any edge cases or invalid input gracefully.

## Notes

The UI should allow the user to select two cities (e.g., 'New York' and 'Miami') and determine if there is a path between them. In this case, the result should indicate that a path exists (New York -> Boston -> Washington, D.C. -> Atlanta -> Miami). If the user selects 'New York' and 'Seattle', the result should indicate that there is no path between them.

- You can decide on the specific design and layout of the user interface.
- You can use any additional libraries or tools that you find helpful.
- Focus on writing clean, readable, and modular code.
- Consider error handling and edge cases in your implementation.
- Feel free to add any extra features or improvements you see fit.
