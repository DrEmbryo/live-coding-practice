# Seven-Segment Display Clock

## Problem statement

You are tasked to create application that displays a digital clock using a seven-segment display visualization. The seven-segment display consists of seven individually controllable segments, which can be turned on or off to represent numbers from 0 to 9.

### Data sample for a task

| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   |

## Requirements

- The clock should update in real-time, showing the current time accurately.
- Ensure that the seven-segment display segments are visually distinguishable and clearly represent the numbers.
- Implement any additional features or enhancements to improve the user experience or clock functionality.

## Notes

- You are free to use any frontend technologies or libraries you are comfortable with.
- Focus on writing clean, well-structured, and maintainable code. Consider the performance and efficiency of your solution, especially for large folder structures.
- Make sure to handle edge cases, such as empty folders or invalid data, gracefully.
